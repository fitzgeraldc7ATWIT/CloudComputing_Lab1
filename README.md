# CloudComputing_Lab2
Creating a Python Command Line Driver Program that accesses all route services <br/>
Using Python unittest library create unit tests for all of your routes <br/>
Add routes that contain: Header parameters, Cookie Parameters <br/>
Add routes to Command Line Driver<br/>

Added Header and Cookie parameters aswell as routes and unittests for those two new routes<br/>
Added Unittests for previous routes<br/>

How to run: <br />
1.Download or clone the git repository. <br />
2.Open the project with pycharm(or another text editor). <br />
3.Install uvicorn and fastapi with pip. <br />
4.In the terminal enter: uvicorn main:app --port 8080 --reload <br />
5.Run the Python Command Line Driver Program in your ide or text editor <br />
6.Run the Unit tests by running the "httpRequestTests.py" in your ide <br />
